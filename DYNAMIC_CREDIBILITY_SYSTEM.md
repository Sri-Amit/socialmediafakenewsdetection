# ðŸš€ Dynamic Credibility System

## **Overview**

The Fake News Detector now features a **dynamic, subject-aware credibility system** that automatically determines which sources are most credible based on the content being analyzed. Instead of using a fixed list of sources, the system intelligently selects and scores sources based on the subject matter, geographic scope, and context of each tweet.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Key Features**

### **1. Content-Aware Source Selection**
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Gemini AI to analyze tweet content and determine subject matter
- **Dynamic Source Selection**: Different credible sources for different subjects
- **Context Awareness**: Considers geographic scope and temporal context
- **Intelligent Scoring**: Sources scored based on relevance and credibility

### **2. Subject-Specific Credibility**
- **Politics**: NYT, Washington Post, WSJ, Politico, The Hill
- **Sports**: ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Bleacher Report, CBS Sports
- **Science**: Nature, Science, Cell, The Lancet, Scientific American
- **Health**: WHO, CDC, NIH, Mayo Clinic, WebMD
- **Business**: WSJ, Bloomberg, Financial Times, Economist, Forbes
- **Technology**: TechCrunch, Wired, Ars Technica, The Verge
- **International**: Reuters, BBC, AP, Al Jazeera, DW

### **3. Multi-Dimensional Scoring**
- **Credibility Score**: Base reliability of the source (0-100)
- **Relevance Score**: How well the source matches the subject (0-100)
- **Overall Score**: Weighted combination of both factors

## **ðŸ”„ How It Works**

### **Step 1: Content Analysis**
```javascript
async function analyzeContentSubject(content) {
    // AI analyzes the tweet to determine:
    // - Primary subject (POLITICS, SPORTS, SCIENCE, etc.)
    // - Secondary subjects
    // - Geographic scope (LOCAL, NATIONAL, INTERNATIONAL)
    // - Temporal context (CURRENT_EVENT, HISTORICAL, PREDICTIVE)
    // - Credibility factors
    // - Confidence level
}
```

### **Step 2: Dynamic Source Selection**
```javascript
function getSubjectSpecificCredibleSources(contentAnalysis) {
    // Combines base sources (Reuters, AP, BBC) with
    // subject-specific sources based on content analysis
    // Returns comprehensive source list with metadata
}
```

### **Step 3: Intelligent Scoring & Ranking**
```javascript
function scoreAndRankSources(newsResults, credibleSources, contentAnalysis) {
    // Scores each source based on:
    // - Credibility (70% weight)
    // - Subject relevance (20% weight)
    // - Geographic scope match (10% weight)
    // Returns ranked list of most credible and relevant sources
}
```

## **ðŸ“Š Scoring Algorithm**

### **Credibility Score (70% weight)**
- **Known Credible Sources**: 75-98 points based on established reputation
- **Unknown Sources**: 40 points base + bonuses for domain patterns
- **Domain Bonuses**: 
  - `.edu` or `.gov`: +20 points
  - Contains "news", "times", "post": +10 points

### **Relevance Score (30% weight)**
- **Subject Match**: +20 points if source specializes in the content subject
- **Geographic Scope**: +15 points if source scope matches content scope
- **Secondary Subjects**: Additional bonuses for multi-subject sources

### **Final Score Calculation**
```javascript
finalScore = (credibilityScore Ã— 0.7) + (relevanceScore Ã— 0.3)
```

## **ðŸŽ¯ Summary**

The Dynamic Credibility System transforms the fake news detector from a **static, one-size-fits-all approach** to an **intelligent, context-aware system** that:

1. **Analyzes Content**: Uses AI to understand what the tweet is about
2. **Selects Sources**: Dynamically chooses the most credible sources for that subject
3. **Scores Intelligently**: Combines credibility and relevance for accurate assessment
4. **Provides Transparency**: Shows users exactly why sources were selected and scored

This system provides much more accurate and relevant fact-checking by ensuring that the sources used for verification are not only credible but also appropriate for the specific type of content being analyzed.
